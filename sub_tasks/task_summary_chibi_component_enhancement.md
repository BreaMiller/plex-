## Task Summary: ChibiCharacter Component Enhancement

### Execution Process:
1. **Component Analysis**: Examined both ChibiCharacter and FloatingModel3D components to understand their differences
2. **Responsive Design Implementation**: Added dynamic scaling based on screen size breakpoints
3. **Camera & Positioning Updates**: Modified camera setup for isometric viewing and repositioned model
4. **Animation Simplification**: Reduced complex animations to minimal Y-axis floating
5. **Visual Theme Updates**: Changed loading indicators to cyan theme for consistency

### Key Changes Implemented:
- **Responsive Scaling**: Added breakpoint-based scaling (25 mobile → 35 tablet → 60 desktop)
- **Camera Configuration**: Updated to 45° FOV with isometric positioning (50, 40, 50)
- **Model Positioning**: Repositioned to (15, -5, 10) aligned to the right
- **Animation Optimization**: Simplified to Y-axis only floating with fixed rotation angles
- **Visual Consistency**: Removed horizontal flip, updated to cyan loading theme
- **Container Behavior**: Changed to standard bounds for background decorative use
- **Material Properties**: Maintained matte appearance (metalness: 0.2, roughness: 0.4)

### Technical Implementation:
- Added responsive scaling callbacks and resize handlers
- Implemented screen size detection with proper breakpoints
- Updated Three.js camera and lighting configuration
- Simplified animation loop for better performance
- Enhanced error handling and loading states

### Final Deliverable:
The ChibiCharacter component now functions as a responsive, properly positioned background decorative element that adapts to different screen sizes while maintaining consistent visual behavior and minimal animation suitable for the Spazz Gaming Platform's design requirements.
