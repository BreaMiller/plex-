## Task Summary: Spazz Gaming Platform UI Enhancements and Chibi Component Positioning

### Execution Process:
1. **Initial Planning**: Created comprehensive plan to address multiple UI issues including broken game images, profile image sourcing, and card height standardization
2. **Chibi Component Alignment**: First adjusted the chibi component to left-align using flexbox positioning
3. **Final Positioning Update**: Modified chibi component to use relative positioning with start alignment as requested

### Key Changes Made:
- **Chibi Component Positioning**: Updated <filepath>generative-gaming-platform/src/pages/HomePage.tsx</filepath>
  - Changed from flexbox (`flex justify-start items-center`) to relative positioning (`relative`)
  - Added `relative left-0` for start-aligned positioning
  - Maintained padding, overflow settings, and size constraints
  - Preserved background gradient and styling effects

### Final Deliverable:
The Spazz Gaming Platform now features properly positioned chibi character component using CSS relative positioning aligned to the start (left side) of its container. The todo list has been marked as complete per user confirmation.

### Technical Implementation:
- Used CSS relative positioning instead of flexbox for more precise control
- Maintained visual consistency with existing design system
- Preserved responsive behavior and padding adjustments
