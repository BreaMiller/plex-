Hades is a god-like rogue-like dungeon crawler that combines the best aspects of Supergiant's critically acclaimed titles, including the fast-paced action of Bastion, the rich atmosphere and depth of Transistor, and the character-driven storytelling of Pyre. As the immortal Prince of the Underworld, you'll wield the powers and mythic weapons of Olympus to break free from the clutches of the god of the dead himself, while growing stronger and unraveling more of the story with each unique escape attempt. The Olympians have your back! Meet Zeus, Athena, Poseidon, and many more, and choose from their dozens of powerful Boons that enhance your abilities. A fully-voiced cast of colorful, larger-than-life characters is waiting to meet you! Grow your relationships with them, and experience thousands of unique story events. New surprises await each time you delve into the ever-shifting Underworld, whose guardian bosses will remember you. Use the powerful Mirror of Night to grow permanently stronger. Permanent upgrades mean you don't have to be a god yourself to experience the exciting combat and gripping story. The rich, atmospheric presentation and unique melding of gameplay and narrative that's been core to Supergiant's games is here in full force: spectacular hand-painted environments and a blood-pumping original score bring the Underworld to life.", "ratings": {"recent_reviews": {"status": "Overwhelmingly Positive", "count": 1272, "percentage": "95%"}, "all_reviews": {"status": "Overwhelmingly Positive", "count": 132070, "percentage": "98%", "total_in_all_languages_count": 262182}}, "media_urls": {"cover_art": ["https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1145360/capsule_sm_120.jpg?t=1715722799"], "other_media": ["https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1145360/extras/c2cf4c126231549edecb3ef6b350ce5a.poster.avif?t=1715722799", "https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1145360/extras/c2cf4c126231549edecb3ef6b350ce5a.webm?t=1715722799", "https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1145360/extras/be2c018a297716c7e8925b55a2390c8f.poster.avif?t=1715722799", "https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1145360/extras/be2c018a297716c7e8925b55a2390c8f.webm?t=1715722799", "https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1145360/extras/a58817e5bddd69ddbf91f349f106e14a.avif?t=1715722799"]}}}
