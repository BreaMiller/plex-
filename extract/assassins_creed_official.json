He joins an ancient organization, transforming into a refined Master Assassin. The game offers a highly versatile Assassin experience with seamless parkour, the largest assortment of tools in the franchise, and visceral assassinations. Players explore a dense, vibrant, and reactive city (Baghdad during its Golden Age) with four unique districts, uncovering secrets, engaging in world events, and interacting with historical figures. It serves as a modern take on the features and gameplay that defined the franchise for 15 years, including a journey to Alamut, the legendary home of the Assassins, as a heartfelt homage to the series' origins.", "ratings": "Not specified", "media_urls": ["https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/6yhBCHftPUgmIbQrkIo95s/9b38883984c66d3409c9356fecad0035/acm-parcour-climb.jpg", "https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/3T0WGmslounugmInajaqFZ/37c897a55e151ea7fca67bef5bf7276/acm-stealth.jpg", "https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/Bx3f9isII2XAKLU1uD5EB/e41d7d22924be10a8c8f35f5fb27765d/acm-bagdad-vista.jpg", "https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/7I9DQU537FS7sFLoOuCfzD/3c46e19238e43ed6f6dc74a68ec323c/acm-alamuth-vista.jpg", "https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/2HfAdifUxHlZpzufnSyevT/e4d4a597486bb08fb38f77fc47a57769/acm-character-block-Basim.png", "https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/114FjVtNCQrW19OOaV8NZJ/615ffc9ca608f430f5fdeb5346e82a54/acm_character-block-Roshan.png", "https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/2HJTYPs6ngAunfR9YOPoZC/1fda0a2141b27fa9f595320a30808500/acm-character-block-nehal.png", "https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/1Rxmihrr5dNX4NYkpuzhgL/0fc39f4a95c9b0cd480f1ade552bd92d/acm-character-block-ali.png", "https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/kJYJ5vV7BJWKLpJgdX0UK/5c300a38c7addd5ba056e20394af5a2b/acm-backbone-thumnbnail.jpg", "https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/5jbBiLd6zLmfBwQr0zPh7z/a83709bcbc3e4723b3a94e3e254a07d1/NewsThumbnail_960x540.jpg", "https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/J3yJr34U2pZ2Ieem48Dwy9uqj5PNUQTn/6rXdkNxDbPcGv1cbwOefPQ/40373e90bfeca15c9e378190e9169765/acm-artbook_soundtrack-promo.jpg"], "specifications": {}, "pricing": {"deluxe_edition_content": ["Outfit", "Weapons set", "Mount skin", "Digital artbook", "Digital selected game's soundtrack"], "access_requirements_for_digital_content": "Requires owning an eligible edition, launching the game at least once, and logging into the platform with the same Ubisoft account used for playing Assassin's Creed Mirage."}, "features": [{"category": "Gameplay & Narrative", "details": ["Narrative-driven action-adventure experience.", "Transformation of Basim from a defiant young man into a refined Master Assassin.", "Most versatile Assassin in franchise history.", "Seamless parkour through the city.", "Largest assortment of tools to date.", "Contracts at Assassinâ€™s bureaus, vital clue collection.", "Stealthy takedowns and visceral assassinations.", "Dense and vibrant city with inhabitants reacting to player's moves.", "Four unique districts: Karkh, Round City.", "Surprising world events and interaction with historical figures.", "Set during the Golden Age of Baghdad.", "Modern take on classic franchise features and gameplay.", "Journey to Alamut, the legendary home of the Assassins.", "Heartfelt homage to the game that started it all."]}, {"category": "Characters", "list": [{"name": "Basim", "role": "Protagonist", "description": "Born in Samarra, grew up in Baghdad.
