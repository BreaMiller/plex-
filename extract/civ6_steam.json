The game features five primary victory conditions: Science (leading to Moon and Martian colonies), Culture (via Tourism), Domination, Score, and the newly added Religious victory. Gameplay involves cities physically expanding, active research in Culture and Technology, and evolving interactions with competing leaders whose agendas are based on historical traits. The game provides tutorial systems for new players and depth for veterans. Numerous post-launch content, including several DLC packs and two major expansions (Rise and Fall, Gathering Storm), have added new leaders, civilizations, and gameplay mechanics. The Civilization VI Anthology bundles the base game with all major expansions and DLCs.", "ratings": "Not specified in content", "official_media_urls": [{"type": "image", "description": "Civilization VI Anthology Cover", "url": "http://assets.2k.com/1a6ngf98576c/6g4WLWytvrgLZUk56jYZl7/7b2db13f7a1bc8a6cb734f8f4fb0f825/Civ_6_Anthology_picture_Desktop.jpg"}, {"type": "image", "description": "Civilization VI: Leader Pass Cover", "url": "http://assets.2k.com/1a6ngf98576c/22tgxppkJYETuTKn3OQ5ly/59c5647f31184b341af8a852ab30124b/Civ6_LP_thumb.jpg"}, {"type": "image", "description": "Civilization VI: New Frontier Pass Cover", "url": "http://assets.2k.com/1a6ngf985776c/4ifYGFgkbPzUvLIDhZzppv/238eb410e19d3e508f9c651699f22d03/Civ_6_New_Frontier_Passpicture_Desktop.jpg"}, {"type": "image", "description": "Civilization VI: Gathering Storm Cover", "url": "http://assets.2k.com/1a6ngf98576c/62CoZzl7HIxZXGLZnHAGQk/8e1745adcfcea05e6a3be22ec26ef332/Civ_6_Gathering_Storm_picture_Desktop.jpg"}, {"type": "image", "description": "Civilization VI: Rise and Fall Cover", "url": "http://assets.2k.com/1a6ngf98576c/1ekOyZVmaVp6VQ6Q70j3oU/e13045fa87135dd7057219d948a906fc/Civ_6_Rise_and_Fall_picture_Desktop.jpg"}, {"type": "image", "description": "Civilization VI: Nubia DLC Cover", "url": "http://assets.2k.com/1a6ngf98576c/3XWwgZvqZytdOGZWHo2NVn/f35a8e92174d2b587cb77afa0d4e9881/2KGMKT_CIV_VI_CivScenario_Pack_Bundle_D2C_Edition_Comparison_Art_1302x738__1_.png"}], "expansions_and_dlcs_summary": [{"name": "Civilization VI Anthology", "content": "Includes base game, Rise and Fall and Gathering Storm expansions, six New Frontier Pass DLC packs, six Leader Pass DLC packs, and all additional leader/scenario DLC packs."}, {"name": "Civilization VI: Leader Pass", "content": "Adds 12 new leaders and six new takes on classic Civilization leaders.
